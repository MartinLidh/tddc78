.SH NAME
CLOG_csync \-  synchronize clocks for adjusting times in merge 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
#include "mpe.h"
void CLOG_csync( root, diffs )
int root;
double diffs[];
.fi
This version is sequential and non-scalable.  The root process serially
synchronizes with each slave, using the first algorithm in Gropp, "Scalable
clock synchronization on distributed processors without a common clock".
The array is calculated on the root but broadcast and returned on all
processes.
