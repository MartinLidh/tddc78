    Special Options for ch_p4 device:

    -e      Use execer to start the program on workstation
            clusters
    -pg     Use a procgroup file to start the p4 programs, not execer
            (default)
    -leave_pg
            Don't delete the P4 procgroup file after running
    -p4pg filename
            Use the given p4 procgroup file instead of creating one.
            Overrides -np and -nolocal, selects -leave_pg.
    -p4wd pathname
            Use pathname as the working directory for the program 
    -p4ssport num
            Use the p4 secure server with port number num to start the
            programs.  If num is 0, use the value of the 
            environment variable MPI_P4SSPORT.  Using the server can
            speed up process startup.  If MPI_USEP4SSPORT as well as
            MPI_P4SSPORT are set, then that has the effect of giving
            mpirun the -p4ssport 0 parameters.

    -leave_pg
            Don't delete the P4 procgroup file after running
