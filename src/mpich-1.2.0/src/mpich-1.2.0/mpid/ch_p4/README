This directory contains the second generation ADI implementation for
the p4 device.  This simply defines the mappings from p4 to the channel
device, and uses LINKS to the appropriate ch2 files.

The p4 -> channel mappings are drawn from the PETSc/Chameleon tools for
mapping between different communication systems.
