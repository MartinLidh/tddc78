These are examples of shared-memory parallel programming using monitors.
The programs are:

  addtwo.gs     - add two vectors using a getsub monitor
  addtwo.ask    - add two vectors using an askfor monitor
  grid.shmem    - solve Dirichlet problem in plane
  gridlog.shmem - same as grid.shmem instrumented with alog
  adquad        - adaptive quadrature

Each of them can be run by redirecting input from the appropriate .data file.
The grid.shmem and adquad programs can also be run interactively.

Note that these examples will run on a uniprocessor with one process, but
p4 does not support shared memory among separate processes on any of the
supported uniprocessors (such as SUN, ATT_3B2, or IBM_RS_6000).
