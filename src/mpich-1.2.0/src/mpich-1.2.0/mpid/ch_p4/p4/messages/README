This directory contains some examples of message-passing programs.  Each has a
master part and a slave part.  There are also a number of sample procgroup
files.

  sr	- simple ring communication.  Prompts for message.  Both master-slave
          and SPMD versions are here.

  sr1   - prompts for a message size and number of times to circulate the
	  message around the ring.

  grid  - message passing version of Dirichlet problem.
	  currently requires 4 processes in procgroup file.

  *.pg	- The procgroup files necessary for running the above programs on
          various configurations of machines.

  vec   - test programs for heterogeneous configurations with differing dat
          representations.

  systest - a general test program for various p4 functions, including
            global operations

  run_delta, run_ipsc, run_ncube - sample scripts for running on the Intel
          Delta, IPSC860, and nCube machines (See manual for specifics of
          how to run on these and other machines.)
