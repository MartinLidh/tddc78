This directory contains some simple Fortran examples contributed by users.

norm - The master program constructs a matrix and distributes its 
       columns to the slave processes to compute the 1-norms of the 
       columns (the sums of the absolute values of the entries).

comm - A stress test for message passing.  Prompts for number of iterations, 
       and sends increasingly large messages (up to length 2^19) to the
       slaves and back in various configurations.

pi   - A program that computes the value of pi by integration.  Based on
       an example from Intel.

*.pg - The procgroup files necessary for running the above programs on
       various configurations of machines.

fslave_main.f - linked with the standalone slave programs
