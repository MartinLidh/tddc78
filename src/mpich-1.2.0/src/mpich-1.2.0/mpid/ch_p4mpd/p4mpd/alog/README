			Preliminary ALOG package


Here are the files necessary to log events from parallel programs running
on any of the following machines: SUN, NEXT, IBM3090, RS6000, SYMMETRY,
BALANCE, MULTIMAX, BFLY1, BFLY2, BFLY2_TCMP, IPSC860_HOST, IPSC860_NODE,
DELTA, TITAN, SGI.

Both C macros and Fortran-callable routines are included.

Log files created during execution are merged with the 'mergelogs' program 
and viewed with upshot.  Upshot now supports state duration histograms and 
a primitive animation facility (Edgewise upshot).

An example will be included soon.
