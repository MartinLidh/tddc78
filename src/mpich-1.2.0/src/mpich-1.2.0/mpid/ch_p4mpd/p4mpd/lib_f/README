This directory contains the Fortran interface to p4.  

The principal files are:


p4f.h        - included in Fortran p4 programs

p4_fort.h
p4_fort.c    
p4_fmaster.c - These contain the Fortran-callable subroutines that 
               interface to the p4 C functions.  They define the 
	       "Fortran interface".

p4_args.c
p4_fargs.f   - These help a Fortran p4 program to obtain command-line
               arguments
