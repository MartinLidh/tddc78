    *        YOUR FORTRAN COMPILER HAS UNRELIABLE ARITHMETIC!!!      *
    *                                                                *
    * Your Fortran compiler believes that x*y-y*x can be different   *
    * from zero.  This is probably the result of bad hardware;       *
    * on some systems, a Multiply-Add combination whose results are  *
    * different from a Multiply and an Add can cause this to happen. *
    * Results on this system, if it alleges to be IEEE, will differ  *
    * from more carefully implemented IEEE systems.                  *
    *                                                                *
    * At least one vendor views this behavior as a feature; if       *
    * commutative arithmetic is important to you, consider using     *
    * compilation options to reduce the amount of optimization or    *
    * eliminate the use of Multiply-Add (this will reduce performance*
    * but you can't always have fast and correct).                   *
    *                                                                *
