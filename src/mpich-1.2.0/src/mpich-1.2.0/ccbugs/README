This directory contains code know to break some C compiler or front end.
The files have these forms:

   ccfail*.title
   ccfail*.c
   ccfail*.txt

   ccwarn*.title
   ccwarn*.c
   ccwarn*.txt

ccfail are programs that cause the compiler to fail; detecting any of
these causes the configure to abort.

ccwarn are warnings with workarounds.  The compiler is STILL broken, but
we have a simple workaround.


The extensions are:
title - string to issue before test
c     - source to test
txt   - message to issue if error occurs
