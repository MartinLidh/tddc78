This directory contains a few simple example programs and a Makefile that
you can copy for your own application programs.  These programs are among the
simplest that are distributed with mpich.  The Makefile is configured for
a particular environment from Makefile.in by the configure command in the
top-level mpich directory.

cpi     - calculates the value of pi using numerical integration, in C

fpi     - basically the same program in fortran

cpilog  - cpi with explicit logging, requires mpe library

systest - simple bandwidth benchmark

fibon - This program calls a recursive function to calculate the nth value
	of the Fibonacci sequence.  fib(1) = 1, fib(2) = 1, 
	fib(i) = fib(i-1) + fib(i-2), i.e., 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...
	This program, and others can be found at the following URL: 
        http://www.hpctec.mcc.ac.uk/hpctec/courses/Fortran90/F90course.html

To make these, type 

  make

To run any one of them, use

  mpirun -np <number of processes> <program name>

There is a symbolic link to mpirun in this directory.  Problems to
mpi-bugs@mcs.anl.gov.
