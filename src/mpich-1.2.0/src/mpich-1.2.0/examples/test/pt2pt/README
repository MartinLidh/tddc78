These files are meant to test the point-to-point layer of MPI.
The runtests script is now setup to use mpirun (from the toplevel util
directory. MPIRUN is installed in $PREFIX/bin if you make install). Of couse,
mpirun is still being ported to various different machines.

All of the following programs use 2 nodes :

Their output is generally in <progname>-<rank>.out

sendrecv - exercises sends and receives of all basic types with
	   large variations in sizes of the messages sent.

isndrcv  - Same as sndrcv, but uses nonblocking pt2pt calls.

overtake - tests that messages sent with send and isend are not
	   overtaking (the standard requires that they are not)
	   by sending a large message followed immediately by several small 
	   ones.

testtypes - Tests the datatypes codes by making several hairy types
	    that should be compatible and trying them out.

Other test programs (which may use more than 2 nodes...) -
probe and probe1 do minor tests on MPI_probe.
hvectest tests vector sends and receives (with derived vector datatypes)
etc...

If you need any help with these programs or find any bugs or make any 
improvements, let me know. I have some improvements in mind for the testing
harness (test.[ch]), because I'm not quite perfectly happy
with it yet... :-) Enjoy.
