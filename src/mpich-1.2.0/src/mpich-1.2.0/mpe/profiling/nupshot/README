Nupshot README

Nupshot is a performance visualization tool that displays logfiles
in the 'alog' format (documented in alog.h), or the PICL v.1 format
(documented in picl.h).

This directory contains nupshot, a new version of upshot that uses
Tcl and C, as opposed to the first version, which was all C, and the
second version, which was all Tcl.

To build:

   ./configure
   make

Tcl 7.3 and Tk 3.6 will need to be installed on your system for
nupshot to build properly.  The configure script will check a number
of places for tcl and tk.  If it does not find them, add the -tcldir
and -tkdir options to configure:

   configure -tcldir=TCLDIR -tkdir=TKDIR

  where
   TCLDIR       = Directory containing tcl.  Must have lib/libtcl.a and
                  include/tcl.h .
   TKDIR        = Directory containing tk 3.3 or later.  Must have lib/libtk.a
                  and include/tk.h .  May be the same as TCLDIR.

More documentation is on the way.

Let me know if there are any features or enhancements you would like
to see in Nupshot.  Send these to mpi-bugs@mcs.anl.gov .

Nupshot was written by Ed Karrels while a student at Argonne National
Laboratory, under the direction of Ewing Lusk.  Additional direction and
development were performed by William Gropp.
