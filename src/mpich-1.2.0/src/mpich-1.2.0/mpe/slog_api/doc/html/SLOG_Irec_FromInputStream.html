Return a pointer to the next interval  record in the given SLOG_STREAM. The interval record returned can be real or pseudo record.

<H2>Modified Output Variables </H2>
<DL><DT><B>returned value </B> - pointer to the next interval record of type 
SLOG_intvlrec_t in the frame buffer.  The "const" 
qualifier indicates that user should NOT modify the
content.  The pointer is NULL when the routine 
encounters error or end of file.

<H2>Usage Notes on this subroutine </H2>
<P>
The routine returns a pointer to the interval record of the various
Bbuf in current frame buffer in the SLOG_STREAM given.  The
routine does NOT create new node/irec.  It just simply returns a pointer
to the existing one in the bi-directional linked list( an internal data
structure ).  If one wants to modify the content of the interval record
without modification of the specified bi-directional linked node, one
should use SLOG_Irec_Copy() to copy the returned record content to a new
record.  The routine also ADVANCES the internal pointer of the specified
linked list buffer.  Also, the routine does NOT gurantee the memory
associated with previously _returned_ interval record be retained in the
next call of the routine.  So if one wants to keep interval record for
future reference, one need to use SLOG_Irec_Copy() to copy
the content of the interval record to another memory location __BEFORE__
calling SLOG_Irec_FromInputStream() again.  The example program,
slog_readtest.c shows the typical way of using this subroutine.

<H2>Notes on SLOG return status code </H2>
There are 5 allowed SLOG returned status codes.  They include
SLOG_SUCCESS, SLOG_FAIL and SLOG_EOF.  Their actual values
are defined in slog.h
<P>
SLOG_SUCCESS is returned when no error is encountered.
<P>
SLOG_FAIL is returned when error is encounted.
<P>
SLOG_EOF is returned when End of file is encounted.
<P>
There are also SLOG_TRUE and SLOG_FALSE which are sued as boolean
values, in particular they are used in boolean functions which
are usually named as IsXXXXX(), AreXXXXX() and HasXXXXX().
