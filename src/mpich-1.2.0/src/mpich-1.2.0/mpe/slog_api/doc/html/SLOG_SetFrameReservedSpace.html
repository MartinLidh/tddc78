<H2>Usage Notes on this subroutine </H2>
The routine is one of the methods provided to reserve frame space
for the pseudo records in the 1st pass of the logfile.  Reservation
of the frame space is only necessary if the completed interval records
are arranged in increasing endtime order and there is no way that
user can rearrange the call sequence of the start event to call
SLOG_Irec_ReserveSpace().  When the completed interval records
are arranged in increasing starttime order, there is no need
to reserve space for the pseudo interval records, so this routine should
NOT be called.  Also if user has knowledge of the start event of the
interval record, like in an event based model where all start and end
events are mixed and are arranged in increasing time order, one
should call SLOG_Irec_ReserveSpace() instead of this routine
to do frame space reservation.
