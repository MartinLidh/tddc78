store the given interval record in the frame buffer and write it out to the disk when the frame buffer is full. 
<H2>Synopsis</H2>
<PRE><CODE>
int SLOG_Irec_ToOutputStream(       SLOG_STREAM      *slog,
                              const SLOG_intvlrec_t  *irec )

<H2>Usage Notes on this subroutine </H2>
The routine provides all the core management of the implementation of
SLOG_STREAM.  Be sure to call SLOG_Irec_SetMinRec() at least once for
the interval record to be appended to the SLOG_STREAM.  Also this routine
can be called in either increasing starttime and endtime order depending
if SLOG_IsIncreasingStarttimeOrder() or SLOG_IsIncreasingEndtimeOrder()
is called.   But NOT both.  And there is time order checking code
if user turns on the corresponding compiler flag.

<H2>Notes on SLOG return status code </H2>
There are 5 allowed SLOG returned status codes.  They include
SLOG_SUCCESS, SLOG_FAIL and SLOG_EOF.  Their actual values
are defined in slog.h
<P>
SLOG_SUCCESS is returned when no error is encountered.
<P>
SLOG_FAIL is returned when error is encounted.
<P>
SLOG_EOF is returned when End of file is encounted.
<P>
There are also SLOG_TRUE and SLOG_FALSE which are sued as boolean
values, in particular they are used in boolean functions which
are usually named as IsXXXXX(), AreXXXXX() and HasXXXXX().
