How to use the Makefile.in in this directory

The Makefile.in file may be used as the source for a Makefile for your MPI
projects.  Once you have modified this file, create a Makefile with the
mpireconfig command:

    mpireconfig Makefile

You will find mpireconfig in the bin directory and in the appropriate library
directory (e.g., lib/sun4/ch_p4).  If MPICH has been built for only a single
system, you can use the one in the bin directory.  Otherwise, use the one
in the library that corresponds to the system you will use.  For example, 
if you have a ch_p4 version (for multiple machines) and a ch_shmem version
(for shared memory on a single machine), you can make your Makefile for the
ch_p4 version with

    lib/sun4/ch_p4/mpireconfig Makefile

and for the ch_shmem version with 

    lib/sun4/ch_shmem/mpireconfig Makefile

(depending on exactly where you are building the files, you may need to
use slighly different paths; for example,
/usr/local/lib/sun4/ch_p4/mpireconfig ).
